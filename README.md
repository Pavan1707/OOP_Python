Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects." An object is a self-contained unit that consists of data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data. OOP aims to organize code in a way that mirrors the real-world entities and their interactions.

Key Concepts of OOP:
Class:

A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and behaviors that the objects of the class will have.
Object:

An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and encapsulates its state (attributes) and behavior (methods).
Encapsulation:

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (object). It hides the internal details of how an object achieves its functionality.
Inheritance:

Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reuse and establishes an "is-a" relationship.
Polymorphism:

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables the use of a single interface to represent different types of objects and behaviors.
Abstraction:

Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential features they share. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality.
